Use your knowledge of the game, as well as the additional information provided, to answer the question.\n\nAnswer the multiple choice question by stating the letter (A, B, C, D) corresponding to the correct choice to the question and nothing else.\n\nThere are three possibilities that each letter can be counted as in Wordle:\n - absent: the letter is not in the word\n - present: the letter is in the word but not in the correct position\n - correct: the letter is in the word and in the correct position\n\nThere are seven combinations of knowledge beforehand for the player regarding each letter in the upcoming guessed word:\n1) we don't know if it's absent/present/correct (we know nothing)\n2) we don't know if it's present/correct (we do know it's not absent)\n3) we don't know if it's absent/present (we do know it's not correct)\n4) we don't know if it's absent/correct (we do know it's not present)\n5) we do know it's absent\n6) we do know it's present\n7) we do know it's correct\n\nBefore the first guess, we know nothing about the letters in the word, so each letter is in state (1). Thus we would write the knowledge state of this guess as:\nA: 1 P: 1 P: 1 L: 1 E: 1\n\nAfter the first guess, we know the state of each letter in the guessed word. For example, if the first word guessed is APPLE and the results were:\n('A', 'absent'), ('P', 'present'), ('P', 'present'), ('L', 'present'), ('E', 'absent')\n\nWe can now use that information to answer knowledge about the letters in the next (second) guess. For example, if the next guess is PLANE we would write the knowledge state of this guess as:\nP: 2 L: 2 A: 2 N: 1 E: 5\n\nNow the results from the second guess is:\n('P', 'correct'), ('L', 'correct'), ('A', 'absent'), ('N', 'absent'), ('E', 'absent')\n\nAnd we can use the information to construct knowledge about the next (third) guess. For example, if the next guess is PLATE we would write the knowledge state of this guess as:\nP: 7 L: 7 A: 5 T: 1 E: 5\n\nIn the following question, you will be given the results of several guesses - both the word guessed and the result of that guess in format as shown above.  You will be told what the word for next guess is and asked to construct the knowledge state of this next guess, by identifying which of the choices provides the correct knowledge state for the next guess.\n\nRemember, answer the multiple choice question by stating the letter (A, B, C, D) corresponding to the correct choice to the question and nothing else.\n\n"
